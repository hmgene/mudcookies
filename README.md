## About us  
We are [Korean Bioinformatcists](https://www.facebook.com/groups/koreanbioinformatics), and friends 
on a tight budget. As funds help do better research, many of us may have to compete endlessly for more oportunities.
As the COVID-19 pandemic changes the world, more opportunities are given to those who can work with remote computing methods.
However, existing scientific frameworks are insufficient to fund these talented researchers.
We encourage all to overcome this obstacle by enhancing our efforts through human-computer collaboration.

## How to join 
Here are the structures where you can start some tasks.
You can setup a project at [project] and collect contributors to work with.
The sources and data are to be stored and shared in [src] and [data], respectively.
These should be simple but useful, and machine readable. 
All the materials are free to update on your responsibility,
but please use issue and pull process to work together if possible.
