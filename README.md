## About us  
We are [Korean Bioinformatcists](https://www.facebook.com/groups/koreanbioinformatics), and friends 
doing research on a tight budget. All of our 4K members know virtuous circle of fund and research, but it is hard to get involved. 
There are many reasons for it but many of them are irreversable because it requires extra efforts that cannot be afforded. 
Hungry people do not have extra energy but can wait for an opportunity or help from others.
We believe people have willingness to help for nothing.
How do we help each other in science?

## Vision and Missions
To evolve researchers studying bio=information.

Evolution is a matter of fitness which can be improved by coperation.
As phenotypic success of individuals is carved in DNA
the group success is memorized in a network.

- We build a network of collaborations built on trust to increase member's fitness to survive in harsh scientific environments.
- On top of the network, we build a novel business model by which members earn practical values.

## How to join 
Here are the structures where you can start some tasks.
You can setup a project at [project] and collect contributors to work with.
The sources and data are to be stored and shared in [src] and [data], respectively.
These should be simple but useful, and machine readable. 
All the materials are free to update on your responsibility,
but please use issue and pull process to work together if possible.
