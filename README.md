## About us  
We are [Korean Bioinformatcists](https://www.facebook.com/groups/koreanbioinformatics), and friends working on bioinformatics [projects](https://github.com/hmgene/mudcookies/projects) using big, expensive single-cell data.
Scientific hunger, exacerbated by social polarization in funding, support and education, reduce survial of diverse research and participation. 
We are helping each other and building a trust-based scientific community.
This fair community starts action first to reduce scientific hunger and loneliness.
Mudcookies are the conceptual resources which can be shared with people for free.

## How to join 
Here are the structures where you can start some tasks.
You can setup a project at [project] and collect contributors to work with.
The sources and data are to be stored and shared in [src] and [data], respectively.
These are simple but useful, and machine readable. 
All the materials are free to update on your responsibility,
but please use issue and pull process to work together if possible.
