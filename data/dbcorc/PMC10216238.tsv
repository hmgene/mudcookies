Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
MYOD1,MYOG,MYF5,MYF6 
(MRFs) comprise Myogenic Differentiation 1 (MYOD1) [9], Myogenin (MYOG/MYF4) [10], Myogenic factor 5 (MYF5) [11], and Myogenic factor 6 (MRF4/MYF6) [12]. 
In healthy adult muscle, transcript levels of MYF6 are the highest of all MRFs, while MYOD1 and MYF4 transcript levels are generally low. MYF5 is expressed in quiescent satellite cells [15].
 MYOD1 and MYF5 are generally viewed as factors responsible for the myogenic determination of cells, while MYF4 and MYF6 are linked to terminal differentiation [13,16].
